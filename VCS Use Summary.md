VCS Use and Management and Development review

I found using the VCS, during the project, very useful with very few issues. The main issue was a user-related error where I mis-configured Git on another device and caused some issues and with constant Github authentication issues, but generally worked really well, and I found it very helpful when switching between computers and having everything up to date. 

I have complied with the organisation's requirements, by using the VCS, messaging pushes to the repo and merging branches when required. I have kept the structure of the repository (repo) structure simplified as much as possible, with branches being named to avoid confusion and to make finding information, within the repo, as easy as possible. 

The main repo I use for this development is a private repo, to keep information secure and private for Global Corporation, and so they can control the access to the repo as required. 

Branches
Files related to reporting, were stored in the reporting branch. The JavaScript files related to the code are stored in the coding branch, and once the project is done, I will merge the files into the main repo, but everything is currently managed in the specific branches. 

Staging and Commits
Files were staged regularly, due to having to constantly change branches, depending on which files I was working on at the time. Each time I staged code, I committed it immediately, so that it was saved to the repo, and so that I could change branches without issues. I never left files staged and not committed, for the risk of adding something to the wrong branch or forgetting to add or commit something. 

Pushes and Pulls
Files were pushed to the relevant branch of the repo as soon as they were staged and committed. This was required to allow branch changes, but also for document integrity. Pulls were sometimes done if I had been doing development on another computer and needed to update the repo on my main computer again, and all of those processes worked without issues, and allowed me to access files across platforms. 

This repo wasnâ€™t forked, as it was created specifically for the project, but when I have worked with forked repositories, I have created pull requests with the primary owner of the main repo that I forked from, with the changes that I made, and sent them the pull request for approval.
